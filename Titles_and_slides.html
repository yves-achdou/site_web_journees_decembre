<p> Recent progress on Hamilton-Jacobi Equations and Deterministic Control Problems with Discontinuities  </p></strong> 
<p> The theory of viscosity solutions has provided a very
satisfactory framework for dealing with a wide variety of deterministic
control problems by the dynamic programming approach. But this theory is
only really effective when the dynamics and costs are continuous, even
if some more general cases can be treated. Recently, much effort has
been made to understand more systematically situations where
discontinuities appear. After recalling these different types of
problems (networks, regional or stratified problems), our aim is to
describe the main results for regional control problems and some
examples of results for standard or not standard stratified problems. </p>

<p>    Gamma-convergence and stochastic homogenisation of free-discontinuity functionals  </p></strong>
		    <p>  We study Gamma-convergence of sequences of free-discontinuity functionals. The main results are: 
compactness with respect to Gamma-convergence, representation of the Gamma-limit in an integral form, 
and homogenisation formulas without periodicity assumptions. These results are then applied to stochastic homogenisation of 
free-discontinuity functionals.</p>

<p> Polynomial-degree-robust liftings in H1 and H(div)</p></strong>
		    
<p>We study liftings of piecewise polynomial data prescribed on faces 
and elements of a patch of simplices sharing a vertex in the H1 and H(div) 
settings. We show stability in the sense that the minimizers over piecewise 
polynomial spaces of the same degree as the data are subordinate in the broken
energy norm to the minimizers over the whole broken H1 and H(div) spaces. Our 
proofs are constructive and yield constants independent of the polynomial degree. 
One important application of these results is in a posteriori error analysis.

<p>  Diffuse interface models of tumor growth: optimal control and other issues</p></strong>
		    <p>We will present some results on  optimal control problems for a diffuse interface model of tumor growth. 
The state equations couple a Cahn-Hilliard equation and a reaction-diffusion equation, which models the growth 
of a tumor in the presence of a nutrient and surrounded by host tissue. The introduction of cytotoxic drugs 
into the system serves to eliminate the tumor cells and in this setting the concentration of the cytotoxic 
drugs will act as the control variable. Furthermore, we will also allow the objective functional to depend 
on a free time variable, which represents the unknown treatment time to be optimized. As a result, we obtain 
first order necessary optimality conditions. Other issues, like the existence of solutions to more complex models, 
including the velocity field, for example, will be discussed. </p>

<p>Description of waves in discrete and in heterogeneous media with dispersive effective equations</p></strong>
<p>Dispersion occurs in media in which waves with different wave-length
travel with different speed. A linear wave equation with constant
coefficients does not show dispersion. A linear wave equation with
periodic coefficients and a small periodicity can be replaced, in the
homogenization limit, by a linear wave equation with constant
coefficients, we hence do not expect dispersive effects. On the other
hand, numerical experiments show that solutions have a dispersive
behavior, at least after long time. We discuss this effect and derive
dispersive effective equations. We furthermore investigate the wave
equation in a discrete spring-mass model.  The discrete character of
the model introduces small-scale oscillations, which result in a
dispersive long time behavior. We derive the dispersive effective wave
equations for the discrete model.

We present joint work, obtained with A. Lamacz, T. Dohnal, and
F. Theil. </p>

<p>  Optimal shape and location of sensors or actuators in PDE models</p></strong>
<p>We consider the problem of optimizing the shape and the location of sensors or actuators for systems whose evolution is driven by a linear PDE model. This problem is frequently encountered in applications where one wants for instance to maximize the quality of the reconstruction of solutions by using only partial observations. For example, we model and solve the following informal question: 
   What is the optimal shape and location of a thermometer? 
We stress that we want to optimize not only the placement but also the shape of the observation domain, over the class of all possible measurable subsets of the domain having a prescribed measure. 
We model this optimal design problem as the one of maximizing a functional that we call the randomized observability constant, which reflects what happens for random initial data, and which is of a spectral nature. Solving this problem is then strongly dependent on the PDE model under consideration. For parabolic equations, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a best domain, regular enough, and whose algorithmic construction depends in general on a finite number of modes. In contrast, for wave or Schrodinger equations, relaxation may occur, and our analysis reveals intimate relations with quantum chaos, more precisely with quantum ergodicity properties of the eigenfunctions. 
These works are in collaboration with Y. Privat and E. Zuazua. </p>

<p>  Adjoint-based optimization of a complete design chain in CFD</p></strong>
<p>An optimization in CFD that covers the complete design chain
including a CAD tool to describe the object to be optimized
is still a severe challenge. In this talk we present the
algorithmic differentiation of the CAD kernel within OpenCASCADE
Technology using the AD tool ADOL-C. This will be coupled with
a correspondingly extended flow solver for optimization purposes
in CFD. First numerical results for the optimization of a U-bend pipe
and of the TU Berlin stator are shown including also a verification of  the computed derivatives.</p>
